# Contributing to Larq

üëç üéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üëç üéâ

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Ask a question or raise an issue

If you have questions about Larq or just want to say Hi you can [chat with us on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/larq).

If something is not working as expected, if you run into problems with Larq or if you have ideas for missing features, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/larq/larq/issues).

## Project setup

To send a Pull Request it is required to fork Larq on GitHub.
After that clone it to a desired directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/my-username/larq.git
```

Install all required dependencies for local development by running:

```shell
cd larq # go into the directory you just cloned
pip install -e ".[tensorflow]" # Installs Tensorflow for CPU
# pip install -e ".[tensorflow_gpu]" # Installs Tensorflow for GPU
pip install -e ".[test]" # Installs all development dependencies
```

## Run Unit tests

Inside the project directory run:

```shell
pytest . -n auto
```

A new version of the documentation will be automatically published once merged into the master branch.

## Code style

We use [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to format all of our code. We recommend installing it as a plugin for your favorite [code editor](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html).

## Publish release

1. Increment the version number in `setup.py`, and make a PR with that change.

2. Wait until your PR is reviewed and merged.

3. Create and push a new tag from the latest `master` branch (e.g. `v0.7.0`).

   ```shell
   git checkout master
   git pull
   git tag <version number>
   git push --tags
   ```

4. A [GitHub action](https://github.com/larq/larq/actions) will automatically publish a release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) based on the tag.

5. Go to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/larq/larq/releases) and publish the draft based on the tag you've just pushed and edit the release notes.
