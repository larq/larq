Larq is an open-source BNN training library developed and maintained by [Plumerai](https://plumerai.com). We believe efficient inference for Deep Learning models will change the world by enabling a multitude of new technologies - from delivery drones and self-driving cars to smart wearables and autonomous Mars rovers.

We think binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) will be the key to bringing this future about. These networks have a much smaller memory footprint than standard neural networks, and their bitwise nature makes it possible to execute the computations extremely efficienciently on specialized hardware.

Larq has been created to make it easier for researchers and developers to explore the possibilities of BNNs. We strongly believe an open approach to knowledge is the way forward, which is why Larq lives under a permissive open-source-software [Apache 2.0 licence](https://github.com/plumerai/larq/blob/master/LICENSE).
